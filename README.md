# Flashzilla

This project is an app that helps users learn things using flashcards.

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Use gestures in SwiftUI
- Make vibrations with UINotificationFeedbackGenerator and Core Haptics
- Disable user interactivity with allowsHitTesting()
- Trigger events repeatedly using a timer
- Be notified when a SwiftUI app moves to the background

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
